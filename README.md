# a-twitch-wedding

The most interesting thing in this project is likely the name. 

A twitchy wedding was called such because of my wife and I got married in San Francisco where she worked, and had to stream the wedding to both the UK and Trinidad where our respective families were. We had originally planned to use YouTube as a more obvious platform however a month prior a [terrorist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch_mosque_shootings) had attacked a mosque and live-streamed it, leading to YouTube restricting their live-streams.

That's why we ended up using the more odd platform Twitch instead, leading to a fairly entertaining moment when a few random people found the stream and started watching.
